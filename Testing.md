# Overall Testing Notes
During the course of creating our application we have gone through multiple iterations of how we aimed to actually implement our vision. Originally, we had three main models we created in ordert to allow users to track various symptoms, and input data each day about whatever they were tracking. These three models were Symptom, Day, and DayLog. Each model went through full testing before moving forward after coding them, but in the end we only have a day model which enveloped the functionality of both Symptom and DayLog. Due to these changes, there is code missing from our home/tests.py file, but it can be found by looking in previous commits.
