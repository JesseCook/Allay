## Allay
Sprint Completed October 20th, 2018

### Goal
We aim to implement the foundation for the app. This will include tracking multiple symptoms, and being able to maintain daily inputs for each.

### Task listing, organized by user story
* As someone with depression and/or anxiety, I want a way to be able to track my symptoms, so that I can objectively look at what helps and what does not.
