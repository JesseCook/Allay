# Sprint One Plan
## Allay
Sprint Completed October 20th, 2018

### Goal
We aim to implement the foundation for the app. This will include tracking multiple symptoms, and being able to maintain daily inputs for each.

### Task listing, organized by user story
* As someone with depression and/or anxiety, I want a way to be able to track my symptoms, so that I can objectively look at what helps and what does not.
  * Familiarize ourselves with coding in Swift, and working in the Xcode enviroment.
  * Build basic UI.
  * Create a list format, where the user can input things they want to track.
  * Maintain user data, so that their list does not disappear when they exit the app.
  * For each item tracked, maintain a list of days where the user can input data about that item.
* As someone with depression and/or anxiety, I want to be able to assign a quick numeric weight to how I am feeling each day, so that I do not have to keep an extensive log each day.
  * Create ranking system, so that every day the user can assign a value to how they're feeling regarding a specific symptom.
  * Make sure that the visual representation of the rank each day is clean, and does more than just boil down their emotion to a number.
  * Calculate the average severity of a symptom given how they've felt each day.
  * Maintain the data that the user inputs for each day.
