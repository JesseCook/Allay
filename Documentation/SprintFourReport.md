# Sprint Four Report
## Allay
Sprint Completed December 2nd, 2018

### Actions to Stop Doing
* As a team we need to have a more structured team scrum meeting system, where everyone meets on time and doesnt push back the agreed time.
 * As time is now a more constrained for us because this is the last sprint, we need to meet on time and adheer to it, as in not pushing it back by an hour or two.

* As individual members of the team, we need to work more constructively and finish work within an apporiate amount of time.
 * Since this is the last sprint, we are short of time and need to get things done quickly, every second counts and slowing down would make implementing the things we need to do more difficult.
 
### Actions to Start Doing
* We need to use the scrum board more throughly, particularly on who is assigned to which task.
 * When a particular task is assigned to someone it is their job to do it within a reasonable amount of time, and if they feel like they won't be able to get it done they should ask for help.
 
### Actions to Keep Doing

* We should keep up the effort that is being put forth.
  * Relative to the first sprint, there is much more effort going in to the project by most all of the members. We should keep this up in future sprints.

* Overall communication has gotten much better, so we should keep this up.
  * Although there is always room for improvement, we should at least continue communicating at the current level.
  
 * We should continue our physical meetings, where our time spent seems to have the highest return on investment.
  * These meetings are becoming more frequent as the quarter comes to a close, we must ensure that they are held as often as we have.
