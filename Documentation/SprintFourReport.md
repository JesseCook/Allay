Sprint Four Report
Allay
Sprint Completed December 2nd, 2018
Actions to Stop Doing
•	As a team we need to stop waiting so long to speak up when we are blocked because we are waiting for another member to finish their test.
o	Sometimes it's not always clear which tasks rely on others being done, so if we find that we need another person's task to be completed to move forward we need to stop waiting so long to speak up.
•	We need to stop relying on teammates to answer all questions that we might have.
o	We are all new to this type of work, so instead of expecting our group members to fix our errors we should start researching how to fix it ourself.
Actions to Start Doing
•	We should start setting specific hours each day that we work on the project.
o	This may be difficult due to our ever changing work loads, but we should try to block out certain hours each day to always work on the project.
•	Each of us should start picking up tasks that need to be done, even if they aren't assigned to us.
o	Some people might have a lighter work load during a given sprint, and if that is the case they should pick up extra tasks even if they weren't originally assigned to them.
Actions to Keep Doing
•	We should keep up the effort that is being put forth.
o	Relative to the first sprint, there is much more effort going in to the project by most all of the members. We should keep this up in future sprints.
•	Overall communication has gotten much better, so we should keep this up.
o	Although there is always room for improvement, we should at least continue communicating at the current level.
