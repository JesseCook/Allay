# Sprint Four Report
## Allay
Sprint Completed December 2nd, 2018

### Actions to Stop Doing
* As a team we need to be more thorough in checking our commits to the master branch, as this is our branch for the most current and completed version of our project.
  * We not only need to pay more attention to detail in this matter, but also set up a proper testing environment that tests the integrity of the code we are committing to the master branch

* As individual members of the team, it is our responsibility to seek out work instead of waiting for it to be assigned to us.
  * As we all currently know, we are strapped for time each sprint, and every minute counts. Knowing this it is important to limit the idle time of each member.
  
### Actions to Start Doing
* We will be setting up a testing framework that integrates with github, CircleCI that we will use to implement continuous integration.
  * This is imperative for our project since it will limit the time group members are running individual tests each time they wish to commit to the master branch, while not sacrificing attention to detail.

* Each of us should start picking up tasks that need to be done, even if they aren't assigned to us.
  * Some people might have a lighter work load during a given sprint, and if that is the case they should pick up extra tasks even if they weren't originally assigned to them.
 
### Actions to Keep Doing

* We should keep up the effort that is being put forth.
  * Relative to the first sprint, there is much more effort going in to the project by most all of the members. We should keep this up in future sprints.

* Overall communication has gotten much better, so we should keep this up.
  * Although there is always room for improvement, we should at least continue communicating at the current level.
  
 * We should continue our physical meetings, where our time spent seems to have the highest return on investment.
  * These meetings are becoming more frequent as the quarter comes to a close, we must ensure that they are held as often as we have.
