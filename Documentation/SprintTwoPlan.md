# Sprint Two Plan
## Allay
Sprint Completed November 4th, 2018

### Goal
We aim to implement the foundation for the app. This will include tracking multiple symptoms, and being able to maintain daily inputs for each.

### Task listing, organized by user story
* As someone first coming to the webapp, I want an easy way to make a profile.
  * Create a user login page.
  * Maintain login information in our database, so that the user can sign in and out.

* As someone with depression and/or anxiety, I want a way to be able to track my symptoms, so that I can objectively look at what helps and what does not.
  * Build basic UI.
  * Create a list format, where the user can input things they want to track.
  * Maintain user data, so that their list does not disappear when they exit the app.
  * For each item tracked, maintain a list of days where the user can input data about that item.
