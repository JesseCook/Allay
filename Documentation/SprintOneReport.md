# Sprint One Report
## Allay
Sprint Completed October 21st, 2018

### Actions to Stop Doing
* The team should maintain a definitive Scrum Meeting schedule.
  * We have had to change our Scrum Meeting times, and because of this our work flow was offset. This lead to subpar productivity.
* As a team we need to stop procrastinating on working through user stories.
  * In this first sprint we were unable to complete any user stories in their entirety. Although we did radically shift our project 3/4th of the way through this sprint, we still did not increase production after solidifying our new goal.
* We need to maintain better communication as a whole.
  * We have struggled at keeping sufficient communication. This has lead to parts of the project not being completed because someone might be waiting on something from another person, where the other person might not even know what is expected of them at this time.
  
### Actions to Start Doing
* We need to really put more effort in to the project, on all fronts.
  * Overall, there hasn't been enough of a comittment, on all ends, to really develop the web application that we have sought to. In this, we must set aside more time, alone and as a group, to work on our project.
* Beyond just putting more effort in to the project, we need to better follow the Scrum methodology.
  * Although we have been following the general Scrum methodology laid down in class, we still are too relaxed when it comes to using our Scrum Board, and Burnup Chart correctly.
* Our team must start tackling tasks as a team, rather than working on them in isolation.
  * A big problem we have come across, is that we wait for pieces of the project to be done by others before we start working on our own piece. So, we need to get better at working more holistically.
 
### Actions to Keep Doing
* We should keep up the general attitude we have had.
  * In every meeting our group has gotten along well, and have been able to communicate our ideas. This is an excellent initial step towards building the project we have in mind.
